## GAIF-4 Governance Metrics

Every pattern integrates [GAIF-4](https://github.com/aman210122/gaif-governance-observatory) metrics:

| Metric | What It Measures | Safe | Critical |
|--------|-----------------|------|----------|
| **T1PR** (Type-1 Pass Rate) | Contaminated/bad outputs passing safety filters | < 0.05 | > 0.15 |
| **CFR** (Compliance Failure Rate) | Outputs violating compliance policies | 0.00 | > 0.01 |
| **EMR** (Emergent Misinformation Rate) | Dangerous content emerging at pipeline level | < 0.05 | > 0.15 |
| **GDR** (Governance Decay Rate) | Governance effectiveness degrading over time | < 0.03 | > 0.05 |

## Getting Started

**For CTOs:** Open any pattern, glance at the spatial diagram. The architecture tells the story in 10 seconds.

**For Architects:** Click any component in the diagram. The detail panel shows configuration, platform mapping, anti-patterns, and GAIF-4 relevance.

**For Engineers:** Run scenarios (buttons at the top). Watch data flow through the architecture. Read the log for technical details.

**For Security/Compliance:** Focus on Governance and Compliance bars. Run PHI and contamination scenarios. Check GAIF-4 metrics.

**For FinOps:** Read cost in response bar. Compare scenarios. Check Economics cross-cutting bar.
