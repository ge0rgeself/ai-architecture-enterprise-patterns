## How Patterns Compose Together

No pattern works alone. Here is how they compose for real products:

```
                    [14. AI Products]
                    Conversational AI, Search, Copilot, CDSS
                           |
              uses patterns 02-13 as building blocks
                           |
    +----------+-----------+----------+-----------+
    |          |           |          |           |
[02. RAG] [03. Agents] [04. Tools] [05. LLMOps] [09. Eval]
    |          |           |          |           |

## GAIF-4 Governance Metrics

Every pattern integrates [GAIF-4](https://github.com/aman210122/gaif-governance-observatory) metrics:

| Metric | What It Measures | Safe | Critical |
|--------|-----------------|------|----------|
| **T1PR** (Type-1 Pass Rate) | Contaminated/bad outputs passing safety filters | < 0.05 | > 0.15 |
| **CFR** (Compliance Failure Rate) | Outputs violating compliance policies | 0.00 | > 0.01 |
| **EMR** (Emergent Misinformation Rate) | Dangerous content emerging at pipeline level | < 0.05 | > 0.15 |
| **GDR** (Governance Decay Rate) | Governance effectiveness degrading over time | < 0.03 | > 0.05 |

## Research Basis

Several patterns are directly based on published research:

| Pattern | Research | Finding |
|---------|----------|---------|
| P07 (Contamination) | [EMG Paper](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19411743) | 74 critical drug interactions across 4,800 trials; collective delusion; gap inversion |
| P07 (Contamination) | ContamPerc Paper | Contamination percolation in multi-agent graphs; T1PR metric |
| P08 (Compliance) | [PHI-GUARD Paper](https://doi.org/10.36227/techrxiv.177220388.80392106/v1) | CARES algorithm; zero PHI violations across 30K MIMIC-IV queries |
| All Patterns | [GAIF v1.0](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19341015) | Governance framework with T1PR, CFR, EMR, GDR metrics |

## Getting Started

**For CTOs:** Open any pattern, glance at the spatial diagram. The architecture tells the story in 10 seconds.

**For Architects:** Click any component in the diagram. The detail panel shows configuration, platform mapping, anti-patterns, and GAIF-4 relevance.

**For Engineers:** Run scenarios (buttons at the top). Watch data flow through the architecture. Read the log for technical details.

**For Security/Compliance:** Focus on Governance and Compliance bars. Run PHI and contamination scenarios. Check GAIF-4 metrics.

**For FinOps:** Read cost in response bar. Compare scenarios. Check Economics cross-cutting bar.
