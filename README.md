## Why This Exists

Most AI architecture guides show you how to build a chatbot. They skip the hard parts: sensitive data routing, compliance gates, governance decay, multi-model orchestration, agent safety boundaries, and the reality that your LLM pipeline has to survive an audit.

This repository collects architecture patterns designed and validated across 18+ years of enterprise architecture in regulated industries. Each pattern includes an interactive browser-based visualization with animated data flow, a production deployment guide, and governance metrics mapping.

**Industries:** Healthcare (HIPAA), Financial Services (SOX, PCI-DSS), Insurance, Government (FedRAMP), Legal, and any organization handling sensitive data under regulatory constraints.

---

## How It Works

**Interactive visualization** - Open the HTML file in any browser. Click scenario buttons to watch data flow through the architecture end-to-end. Click any section to expand and explore sub-components. No install, no dependencies.

**Production deployment guide** - Comprehensive documentation covering component specs, deployment topology, security controls, regulatory mapping, implementation checklist, and cost model.

Every pattern includes quantitative metrics from [GAIF-4](https://github.com/aman210122/gaif-governance-observatory):

| Metric | What It Measures |
|--------|-----------------|
| **T1PR** | Contaminated outputs bypassing safety filters |
| **CFR** | Policy violations in completed requests |
| **EMR** | Dangerous content emerging at the pipeline level |
| **GDR** | Governance effectiveness degrading over time |
